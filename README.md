Setting Expectations for Hydrologic Model Performance with an Ensemble of Simple Benchmarks

## Data requirements
< To do >


## Computational environment
The analysis uses both Python (for the benchmarks and plotting), and Matlab (for the model calibration part).

### Python
Note: analysis was performed while the `hydrobm` package was still under development and not available on `pypi` yet, so the `hydrobm` imports in the Python code are based on a situation where the `hydrobm` code is on the system but not installed by a package manager. Adjust accordingly if needed.
