Setting Expectations for Hydrologic Model Performance with an Ensemble of Simple Benchmarks

## Code explanation


## Data requirements
This paper uses the CARAVAN data set v1.4 (Kratzert et al., 2023, 2024). When attempting to replicate this work, download the CARAVAN data manually and update data locations in the code.

## Computational environment
The analysis uses both Python (for the benchmarks and plotting), and Matlab (for the model calibration part).

### Python
Note: analysis was performed while the `hydrobm` package was still under development and not available on `pypi` yet, so the `hydrobm` imports in the Python code are based on a situation where the `hydrobm` code is on the system but not installed by a package manager. Adjust accordingly if needed.
